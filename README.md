# react-native-fitzpo-logging-keyboard

Don't run `yarn install` in the root project!! It prevents the example app from
running correctly.

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-fitzpo-logging-keyboard --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-fitzpo-logging-keyboard`

## Usage
```javascript
import FTZTextInputWithLoggingKeyboard from 'react-native-fitzpo-logging-keyboard';

// TODO: What to do with the module?
FTZTextInputWithLoggingKeyboard;
```
